# order_items dataset
This dataset includes data about the items purchased within each order.

## Example:
The order_id = 00143d0f86d6fbd9f9b38ab440ac16f5 has 3 items (same product). Each item has the freight calculated accordingly to its measures and weight. To get the total freight value for each order you just have to sum.
The total order_item value is: 21.33 * 3 = 63.99
The total freight value is: 15.10 * 3 = 45.30
The total order value (product + freight) is: 45.30 + 63.99 = 109.29
